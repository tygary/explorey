#
# The Bat Queen: Your party stumbles upon the den of the great Trash Bat Queen, a powerful god of the underworld. At the heart of the cavern lies the slumbering giant, but behind it lie riches untold.
# To emerge victorious from this boss battle, your party must navigate through the following challenges and suceed on at least two out of three:

# 1. The Elusive Shadows: As you try to sneakily cross the cavern, you hear a scurrying of wingbeats floods as you become engulfed in a swarm of bats.  If anyone in your party has a Sneakiness score of 17 or higher, then you are able to slip through the swarm unharmed.  Otherwise, your party is clawed up and injured by the swarm.
# 2. The Queen Awakens: The Bat Queen stirs awake and starts opening her eyes.  You have one brief moment to use an ability or item to distract her before she fully awakens.  If you fail, she will attack your party with her powerful claws.
# 3. Fight or Flight: Your only chance is to scare the Bat Queen into running back into the underworld.  Use an ability or item to convince her to leave.  If you succeed, she will flee.  If you fail, she stays to guard her treasure.

# If you fail two or more of these challenges, then your party is defeated and your characters lose a life.
# If Bat Queen stayed, but you succeeded on the other two challenges, then you are able to escape with your life.
# If you succeeded on all three, then you frolic gleefully in the mountains of riches.  Increase all of your skills by +1 and get a prize.
